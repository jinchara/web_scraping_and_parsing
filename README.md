Stack Overflow Scraper:
This is a Python script that scrapes questions, views, and votes data from Stack Overflow using the BeautifulSoup library. It retrieves the most voted questions and saves the information in a CSV file.
How it works:
The script sends HTTP requests to the Stack Overflow website, specifying the desired sorting criteria and page size. It then parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup and extracts the relevant information from the page. The question, views count, and votes are extracted from each post summary and saved in a CSV file. The script continues to scrape data from subsequent pages until the desired number of pages is reached.
